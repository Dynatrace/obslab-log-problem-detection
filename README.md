In this hands-on demo, you will send logs from the OpenTelemetry demo application to Dynatrace.

You will induce a problem which Dynatrace DAVIS will detect and thus raise a problem report based on the Observability data.

The logs include span and trace IDs meaning you will be easily able to drill between signal types to see logs in the context of the distributed trace and vice versa.
